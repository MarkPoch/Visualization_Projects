I began by opening all the data in Google Sheets.

First thing I noticed was that the values where in a wide data set format. Also the values where spaced in a way where I was unable to convert them from text to numeric values

First thing I had to do was Find & Replace any spaces with "\s" to find multiple spaces within the values. I cleaned that up, and made them all a numeric currency form

Next I imported the data into Power BI, and formatted the tables

I changed the format from Wide to Long so that I was able to have each value correspond with a date, instead of all the values under one certain week

I got rid of the image_url tab as it was unncessary

I imported a Date set to make better analysis with the existing dates that where there and to have wuarter and yearly values in my visualization

After that the Data was clean and usable, so I began creating my presentation
