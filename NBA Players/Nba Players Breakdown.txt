--I began by finding this Dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data)

--I found the data to be very interesting and clean, so I downloaded it & imported it to Power BI

--Most coloumns where useful, so I left the data set as is, and began to filter through the data through visuals

--I changed certain values to have less decimal spots, as so many where not needed for the visuals, and allowed my data to be unbiased

--From then on I began breaking down ideas to compare values and allow them to be shown

--Noticed too much data was being deisplayed, so I applied a few filters to the visuals to allow it to limit the amount of dat shown in each visual, and have it organized better
